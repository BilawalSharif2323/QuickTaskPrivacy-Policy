        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Quickcontractors.com Inc.</strong> built the Quick Task Mobile app as a free internal app for technicians working with Quickcontractors.com Inc. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when using the app.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect personal and sensitive information to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app. The information we collect is used to manage work orders, synchronize data, and improve communication between contractors and customers. The specific types of data we collect and how we use it are outlined in the sections of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the relevant sections to understand the details of the data collected and how it is utilized.</p>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <p>Background Location: The app requires background location access to update the technician’s last known location. This ensures accurate estimated arrival times (ETAs) for customer appointments and dynamically updates the track-and-trace link for customers. This feature operates in the background, even if the app is not actively in use, to provide real-time updates for efficient job management.</p>

        <h3>Images/Videos Permission</h3>
        <p>The app requires access to videos and images for capturing and viewing media related to work orders. Technicians will submit media in three categories: Pre-work, In-progress, and Post-work. These media files are essential for documenting the service process. Additionally, the app allows users to view and manage media files such as images and videos captured during service delivery. By using this permission, we ensure that users can interact with and manage their media within the app. We obtain necessary consent before accessing any media files and comply with privacy standards to protect user data.</p>

        <h3>Microphone Permission</h3>
        <p>The app may request access to the microphone to facilitate voice-related features, such as recording audio notes or enabling voice commands during service delivery. We obtain necessary consent before accessing the microphone and ensure that all recordings are handled securely.</p>

        <h3>Calendar and Contacts Permission</h3>
        <p>The app may request access to the calendar to help schedule work orders and manage appointments. Contacts access may be required for communication features, such as automatically syncing contacts for quicker communication with clients or contractors. We obtain necessary consent before accessing your calendar and contacts and ensure the data is used solely for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>The app will request permission to send notifications to users. These notifications may include updates on work orders, reminders for appointments, or system alerts. You can manage notification preferences through your device settings. We ensure that notifications are relevant to the app’s functionality and that your consent is obtained before sending them.</p>

        <h2>Data Sync and Offline Mode</h2>
        <p>The app supports offline mode, allowing users to continue their work without needing an active internet connection. Any network requests made while offline are stored locally in an SQLite database. Once the device regains connectivity, the app uses a background service to sync the locally stored data with the server. This ensures that users' data is kept up-to-date and that their experience is seamless, even when they are not connected to the internet.</p>
		<h2>User Awareness</h2>
		<p>Users are informed about the ongoing syncing process through UI elements and notifications. We use the FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC permission to run the sync process as a foreground service, ensuring that the data sync is not interrupted by background execution limits.</p>
        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>Our Service will collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This data is typically used to help identify problems that may cause errors within the application. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that is commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly; however, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information to improve their services. The Service will ask you to accept or refuse these cookies. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Service that require these cookies.
</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We implement commercially acceptable methods to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related tasks</li>
            <li>To analyze how the Service is used</li>
        </ul>
		<p>If a third party is used on this Service, they will have access to your personal information for the purpose of performing the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by Quickcontractors.com Inc. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes made to the Privacy Policy will take effect immediately after they are posted on this page.
